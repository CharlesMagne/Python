## Objects
data in python is represented by objects and relationships between Objects
* mutable - values can change
* immutable - values cannot be changed
bulk of python library consists of models that you import
* object type - number, string, list
* object values - data value contained by the object
* object identity - identity number for the object - each distinct object in the computer's memory will have its own ID number
Attributes:
* data
* functions
* both

* data Attributes
* method - preforms function on object
* instance - occurance of an object

## Modules an Methods
libaries of code you can import. <br/>
`import math`

* namespace - container of names shared by objects tat typically go together. to prevent naming conflicts

python executes code with in the created namespace. Example np executes code with in the numpy namespace
`np.bla` vs `math.bla`

`help(name.upper)` name.upper is a function bound to name objects
VS `help(name.upper())` wrong -
